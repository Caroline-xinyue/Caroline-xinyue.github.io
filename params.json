I have experience in Java for a year, \r\nPython for 6 months and JavaScript for 2 months. I am also passionate about Machine Learning and have some background in statistics and probability. \r\nI love programming and solving real life problems, and I am a dedicated deep-thinker and fast-learner. I will be an Engineering Practicum intern\r\nthis summer at Google.inc, and I am currently in the host-matching phase.\r\n\r\n### My blogs\r\nSee my blogs at http://lexiexzhang.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\n### Get in touch\r\nFeel free to send me an email or drop me a message on Facebook if you would like to talk or connect.\r\n\r\n* &nbsp;&nbsp; Name: Xinyue (Lexie) Zhang\r\n* &nbsp;&nbsp; Address: 101 N.Merion Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010\r\n* &nbsp;&nbsp; Email: lexiexzhang@gmail.com\r\n* &nbsp;&nbsp; Linkedin: [lexiexzhang@linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinyuezhang1)\r\n* &nbsp;&nbsp; Facebook: [lexiexzhang@facebook](https://www.facebook.com/caroline.trujano)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
